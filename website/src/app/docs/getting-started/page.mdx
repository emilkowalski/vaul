# Snap Points

Snap Points are used to create steps within your drawer. Defined through the `snapPoints` prop like `snapPoints={["150px", "240px"]}`. This means that each drag will snap to the nearest step rather than only opening or closing the drawer.


```jsx
export function Drawer() {
	return (
		<h1>test</h1>
	)
}
```
