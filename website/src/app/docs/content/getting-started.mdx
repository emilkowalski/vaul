description: "Snap Points are a way to define a set of points that the drawer can snap to during a drag operation. This means that a drawer no longer only has to be open or closed, but can also be partially open."

## Configuration

To enable snap points you need to pass a `snapPoints` prop which is array of points that the drawer can snap to. Each point can be a pixel value or a fraction. For example `240px` will show 240 pixels of the drawer, while `50%` will show half of the drawer.

```jsx
<Drawer.Root snapPoints={["120px", "240px", 1]}>
	// ...
</Drawer.Root>
```
