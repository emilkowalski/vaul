title: "Snap Points"
description: "Snap Points are a way to define a set of points that the drawer can snap to during a drag operation. This means that a drawer no longer only has to be open or closed, but can also be partially open."

## Examples

### Interact with background

Combine `modal={false}` with snap points to be able to interact with the background while the drawer is open.

  <SnapPointsNoModal />

### Snap to sequential points

Disable velocity-based snapping by using `snapToSequentialPoint` prop. This means that a snap point won't be skipped even if the velocity is high enough. Useful if each snap point in a drawer is equally important.
