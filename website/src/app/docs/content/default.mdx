## Examples

### With scaled background

Set the `shouldScaleBackground` prop to `true` to scale the background. Add `data-vaul-drawer-wrapper` attribute to the element that should be scaled, this should usually be a wrapper around the content of the page.

### Controlled

You can use the `open` prop to programmatically open or close the drawer. You can also pass the `onOpenChange` prop which will be called when the open state of the dialog changes, it's useful if you want to react to esc/outside clicks when controlled.
