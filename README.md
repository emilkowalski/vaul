Vaul is an unstyled drawer component for React that can be used as a Dialog replacement on tablet and mobile devices. You can read about why and how it was built [here](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/building-a-drawer-component).

## Usage

To start using the library, install it in your project:,

```bash
npm install vaul
```

Use the drawer in your app.

```jsx
import { Drawer } from 'vaul';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Drawer.Root>
      <Drawer.Trigger>Open</Drawer.Trigger>
      <Drawer.Portal>
        <Drawer.Content>
          <Drawer.Handle />
          <p>Content</p>
        </Drawer.Content>
        <Drawer.Overlay />
      </Drawer.Portal>
    </Drawer.Root>
  );
}
```

## API Reference

### Root

Contains all parts of a dialog. Use `shouldScaleBackground` to enable background scaling, it requires an element with `[vaul-drawer-wrapper]` data attribute to scale its background.
Can be controlled with the `value` and `onOpenChange` props. Can be opened by default via the `open` prop.

Additional props:

`closeThreshold`: Number between 0 and 1 that determines when the drawer should be closed. Example: threshold of 0.5 would close the drawer if the user swiped for 50% of the height of the drawer or more.

`scrollLockTimeout`: Duration for which the drawer is not draggable after scrolling content inside of the drawer. Defaults to 500ms.

`snapPoints`: Array of numbers from 0 to 100 that corresponds to % of the screen a given snap point should take up. Should go from least visible. Example `[0.2, 0.5, 0.8]`. You can also use px values, which doesn't take screen height into account.

`fadeFromIndex`: Index of a `snapPoint` from which the overlay fade should be applied. Defaults to the last snap point.

`modal`: When `false` it allows to interact with elements outside of the drawer without closing it. Defaults to `true`.

`handleOnly`: When `true` only allows the drawer to be dragged by the `<Drawer.Handle />` component. Defaults to `false`.

`direction`: Direction of the drawer. Can be `top` or `bottom`, `left`, `right`. Defaults to `bottom`.

`preventScrollRestoration`: When `true` it prevents scroll restoration when the drawer is closed after a navigation happens inside of it. Defaults to `true`.

### Trigger

The button that opens the dialog. [Props](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog#trigger).

### Content

Content that should be rendered in the drawer. [Props](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog#content).

### Overlay

A layer that covers the inert portion of the view when the dialog is open. [Props](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog#overlay).

### Title

An accessible title to be announced when the dialog is opened. [Props](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog#title).

### Description

An optional accessible description to be announced when the dialog is opened. [Props](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog#description).

### Close

The button that closes the dialog. [Props](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog#close).

### Handle

A drag hint (also known as grabber). Shows people that they can drag the drawer to resize it; they can also tap it to cycle through the snap points, and double tap quickly to close the drawer. Set `preventCycle={true}` to stop this behavior. If you want to change the handle's hit area you can do so by styling the `[vaul-handle-hitarea]` selector (Defaults to 44x44 on mobile devices).

### Portal

Portals your drawer into the body.
